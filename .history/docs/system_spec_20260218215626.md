. System Architecture
To keep this "sleek" and scalable, I recommend a Decoupled Agentic Architecture.

The Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI (for that modern, minimalist dashboard).

Backend: FastAPI (Python). Python is non-negotiable here because of the superior AI agent libraries.

Agent Framework: LangGraph or CrewAI. These allow you to manage the "state" (e.g., "Scraping" -> "Drafting" -> "Applying").

Scraping: Firecrawl or Playwright. Firecrawl is specifically designed to turn websites into clean Markdown for LLMs.

Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for tracking application statuses and storing generated PDFs.

2. Infrastructure & Modern Design
For a "sleek" feel, your UI should focus on Transparency. The user wants to see the AI "thinking" and "moving" through the web.

UI/UX Principles:
Bento Grid Dashboard: Use a bento-style layout to show "Active Scrapes," "Resumes Crafted," and "Success Rate."

Real-time Logs: Use WebSockets to stream the agent's progress (e.g., "Agent navigated to Workday portal...") to the UI.

Glassmorphism: Use subtle blurs and dark mode by default to give it that high-end AI tool aesthetic.

3. Implementation Guide: The "Open Code" Logic
Phase A: The Scraper (Job Intel)
The agent needs to extract more than just text; it needs the "vibe" of the company.

Python
# Conceptual logic for the scraper
from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="your_key")
job_data = app.scrape_url(url, params={'formats': ['markdown']})
# This gives MiniMax clean text without HTML noise.
Phase B: The MiniMax 2.5 Prompting
To pass ATS, MiniMax needs to act as a Professional Resume Optimizer. Your prompt should enforce a "STAR" (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format.

System Prompt Example:

"You are an expert Career Coach and ATS specialist. Analyze the provided job description for keywords, technical requirements, and tone. Rewrite the user's base resume to align with these keywords while maintaining 100% honesty. Output the result in structured JSON."

Phase C: The Agentic Applicator
This is the hardest part. Many job portals (Workday, Greenhouse) have bot detection.

Strategy: Use Browser-use (an open-source library) which allows MiniMax 2.5 to "see" the screen and click buttons like a human.

Human-in-the-loop: Before the agent clicks "Submit," send a notification to the user to "Approve" the generated resume.

4. Infrastructure Guide
Deployment: Host the Next.js frontend on Vercel.

Worker: Host the Python agent on Railway or Render (as it needs to stay alive for long scraping/applying sessions).

PDF Generation: Use React-pdf on the frontend or ReportLab on the backend to ensure the output is a machine-readable PDF (essential for ATS).

Notifications: Use Resend for sleek transactional emails and the Calendly API to check for recruiter invites automatically.
